1. How to compile
Use config in here file as .config in u-boot-stable/
make -j4
cd sd_fuse
sh sd_fusing.sh /dev/mmcblk0 

2. Version tried:
include/generated/version_autogenerated.h
#define PLAIN_VERSION "2016.07"
#define U_BOOT_VERSION "U-Boot " PLAIN_VERSION
#define CC_VERSION_STRING "gcc (GCC) 5.3.1 20160409"
#define LD_VERSION_STRING "GNU ld version 2.26.20160125"


3. Info:

Just fusing u-boot-dtb.bin seems to be all that is required. see sd_fusing.sh
since other files are already fused. But in case you need to start from fresh,
use sd_fusing.all.sh to fuse all required files.

Problems mentioed below are fixed with 
	using config file here as .config
	using boot.scr from boot.txt
	as:
	mkimage -C none -A arm -T script -d boot.txt boot.scr
	copy boot.scr to first partition ( where /dev/mmcblk0p1 is mounted )
	you also need to use a newer kernel or compile kernel 4.8.y using
	the config file in linux-4.8.y
	

missing SD/MMC support selection?
boots fine, 
no console messages, only tty1 messages on screen once kernel boots.
screen size not proper, though 1024x768 seleted
/proc/cmdline : wrong
	root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootwait console=ttySAC1,115200n8
seems like exactly what is mensioned in doc/README.odroid probably kernel
configuration issue.
