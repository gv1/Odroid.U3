1. How to compile
make odroid_defconfig
make xconfig
	select SD/MMC support?
make -j4


2. Version tried:
include/generated/version_autogenerated.h
#define PLAIN_VERSION "2016.07"
#define U_BOOT_VERSION "U-Boot " PLAIN_VERSION
#define CC_VERSION_STRING "gcc (GCC) 5.3.1 20160409"
#define LD_VERSION_STRING "GNU ld version 2.26.20160125"


3. Info:
missing SD/MMC support selection?
boots fine, 
no console messages, only tty1 messages on screen once kernel boots.
screen size not proper, though 1024x768 seleted
/proc/cmdline : wrong
	root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootwait console=ttySAC1,115200n8
seems like exactly what is mensioned in doc/README.odroid probably kernel
configuration issue.

just fusing u-boot-dtb.bin seems to be all that is required. see sd_fusing.sh
